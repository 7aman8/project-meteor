_Project Meteor_ is an interactive asteroid simulator that utilizes NASA's Near-Earth Objects (NEO) dataset to calculate and visualize the effects and impact of asteroids that may have or might strike the Earth. Users select an asteroid from NASA's database and simulate the strike of it on Earth, while modifying values like angle. An impact is visualized in three radii: the crater radius, the fireball radius (thermal radius), and the blast radius (shockwave radius). The simulator features a 3D model of Earth that can be panned and rotated around. The simulator uses mathematical and physical calculations to visualize the range of impact done by various asteroids. It serves both an educational purpose by helping people understand the threat of asteroids and practical applications for researchers and educators who are studying planetary defense scenarios.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later is recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/7aman8/project-meteor.git
    ```
2.  Navigate into the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd project-meteor
    ```
3.  Install the required NPM packages:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  Start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).
