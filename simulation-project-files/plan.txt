Here's a solid prototyping roadmap for your 3D meteor impact simulator:

## Phase 1: Core 3D Framework (Week 1)
**Basic Scene Setup:**
- Create a 3D Earth sphere (start with a basic sphere, texture later)
- Set up orbital camera controls (mouse to rotate around Earth)
- Basic lighting setup
- Simple skybox

**UI Foundation:**
- Create asteroid selection panel (start with 2-3 hardcoded asteroids)
- Impact location picker (raycasting from camera to Earth surface)
- Basic parameter sliders (size, velocity, angle)
- "Launch Impact" button

## Phase 2: Physics Simulation (Week 2)
**Impact Mechanics:**
- Asteroid trajectory visualization (line or particle trail)
- Collision detection with Earth surface
- Basic crater formation (deform mesh or spawn crater prefab)
- Simple shockwave ring expansion

**Core Systems:**
- Damage calculation based on asteroid parameters
- Basic debris particle system
- Simple atmospheric entry effects (particle trail)

## Phase 3: NASA Data Integration (Week 3)
**Data Pipeline:**
- Research NASA Near Earth Object API
- Create data fetching system (HTTP requests in Godot)
- Parse JSON data into asteroid objects
- Populate UI with real asteroid names/parameters

**Enhanced Simulation:**
- Use real asteroid composition data for impact calculations
- Integrate actual size/velocity data
- Add asteroid type variations (rocky, metallic, icy)

## Phase 4: Visual Polish & Effects (Week 4)
**Enhanced Graphics:**
- Earth texture mapping with real satellite imagery
- Improved crater formation (maybe heightmap deformation)
- Better particle effects for debris/dust clouds
- Atmospheric heating glow effects

**Advanced Features:**
- Multiple impact locations
- Tsunami simulation for ocean impacts
- Population impact estimates overlay
- Before/after comparison views

## Technical Tips for Godot:

**For NASA API Integration:**
```gdscript
# Use HTTPRequest node for API calls
var http_request = HTTPRequest.new()
add_child(http_request)
http_request.request_completed.connect(_on_request_completed)
http_request.request("https://api.nasa.gov/neo/rest/v1/neo/browse?api_key=YOUR_KEY")
```

**For Earth Interaction:**
- Use `get_world_3d().direct_space_state.intersect_ray()` for surface picking
- Consider using a separate collision sphere slightly larger than visual Earth

**Performance Considerations:**
- LOD system for Earth detail based on camera distance
- Limit particle counts for web deployment
- Use object pooling for debris

Start with Phase 1 and get the basic interaction loop working first - you can always add complexity later. The key is having something interactive early that you can iterate on.

Which phase feels most challenging to you? The NASA API integration or the 3D physics simulation?
